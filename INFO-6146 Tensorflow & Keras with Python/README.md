This course offers a hands-on and applied journey into deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras. Students will build and tune real models, extract and preprocess open data, and implement both supervised and unsupervised learning. The course culminates with advanced sequence modeling using HMMs and a final project demonstrating technical, analytical, and communication skills.
